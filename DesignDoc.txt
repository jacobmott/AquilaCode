idea for the NX/Nestjs/angular site

-Its a game
-its a space game
-You have a ship
-its flying around in space
-theres a grid
-its moving along the grid
-its got a x/y position on the grid
-the grid is infinite
-You dont control the ship
-its automated
-you can set it to stop or go
-you can select a destination(galaxy, solor system, planet)
-When you reach a destination, you are given choices based on the destination
-Along the way you can encounter other ships
-if they get within a certain distance, you can choose to engage or not
-your ship has sections
-each section can be configured
-you get items for each section from fighting other ships and from destinations
-you can play music from a music player
-theres an AI presense on the ship you can chat with and it talks back

-design
-Its all angular with UI components
-The ship is an angular UI component
-you can select sections of the ship and each section is its own angular component
-The grid the ship is on(the universe) is an angular component
